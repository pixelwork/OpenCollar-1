use the main core from the collar minus the couples animations prim, the leash prim can be turned and made into a visable ring so it shows at the front of the right wrsit cuff as a leashing point

use standard oc_leash and oc_particle from the collar

notecards- .info , .license

other occ_ scripts are slightly modified collar scripts
